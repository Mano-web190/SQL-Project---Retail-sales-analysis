This project demonstrates SQL skills commonly used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. It covers database setup, data exploration, cleaning, and business-focused SQL queries to extract actionable insights.

üìÅ Project Structure
**Database Setup**
  Create a database p1_retail_db.
  Define the retail_sales table with fields such as:
transactions_id, sale_date, sale_time, customer_id, gender, age, category, quantity, price_per_unit, cogs, total_sale.
**Data Cleaning**
  Check for null values in key columns.
  Remove any incomplete records.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  Total number of records.
  Unique customer count.
  List of unique product categories.
**Business Analysis (SQL Queries)**
  Daily, monthly, and shift-based sales analysis.
  Customer behavior and product category insights.
  High-value transaction detection.
  Top customers based on total sales.
